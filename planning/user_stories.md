Description: 
A roommate bills auto-calculator. Sometimes one person buys something that everybody needs, and wants the other roommates to pay them back. Sometimes this is hard to track and is forgotten, and people end up not paying them back. Users add each other to a "Household" and you post bills to it immediately, and it automatically divides the bill between each person--so everyone owes the person posting the bill. Maybe push notifications for everyone. Auto posts reoccurring bills like: Rent, electricity, internet bill, heat etc.
